Please remember to change the C:\ (C drive paths within the codes to match your system accordingly. 
Paths you will be changing will include: 
The Global.properties path within the base class 
The file location of the screenshot commands within the testcase classes Path of the chromedriver .exe file
Please remember to change the test data in each test class to a valid username and password. 
I haven't supplied one because they are my personal gmail login details.
If you take a look at the screenshots, you will find evidence that the tests all ran correctly.
Many thanks and I look forward to be invited to discuss the test further.
